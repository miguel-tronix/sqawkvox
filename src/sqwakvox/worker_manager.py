"""Managed Celery worker subprocesses for Sqwakvox.

Historically the TUI required a *separately started* worker process::

    Terminal 1:  python -m sqwakvox.run_worker
    Terminal 2:  python -m sqwakvox

:class:`WorkerManager` removes that second terminal: when a document is
loaded the TUI asks the manager to ensure workers exist for the queues that
need serving, spawning ``python -m sqwakvox.run_worker`` child subprocesses
when needed.

Two kinds of managed workers exist:

* **One shared Docling ingest worker** on :data:`DOCLING_QUEUE`
  (``sqwakvox.docling``).  It consumes every document-conversion task, so
  Docling's heavyweight OCR/layout models are loaded at most
  ``DOCLING_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`` times machine-wide instead of once per
  open tab.
* **One isolated agent worker per document tab** (``sqwakvox.doc<N>``).
  Each tab's data-store, cross-validation, and agent tasks run on its own
  worker, so a long-running agent query on one tab never blocks chat on
  another.  These workers never construct a ``DocumentConverter``.

Workers are terminated on :meth:`stop_all` (wired to the app's unmount and
an ``atexit`` backstop).  Set ``SQWAKVOX_MANAGED_WORKERS=0`` to disable the
whole mechanism and return to the bring-your-own-worker workflow.
